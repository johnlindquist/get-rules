# Create Automation Rule from Conversation

**DO THIS:** Analyze the conversation so far and extract reusable scripts, tool calls, and workflows into a structured automation rule template.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Scan Conversation for Automation Patterns
Look for:
- Repeated command sequences
- Tool invocations with specific parameters
- Multi-step workflows that achieved a goal
- Configuration patterns that could be reused
- Problem-solving approaches that worked

### 2. Extract Key Components

#### Scripts and Commands
```bash
# List all bash commands executed
# Include their purpose and output expectations
```

#### Tool Usage Patterns
- Which tools were called
- Parameter patterns used
- Sequencing of tool calls
- Success/failure patterns

#### Decision Points
- Conditional logic applied
- Error handling approaches
- Fallback strategies used

### 3. Create Automation Template

<template>
---
description: [Brief description of what this automation accomplishes]
globs: [File patterns if applicable, otherwise leave empty]
alwaysApply: false
---
# [Automation Name]

**DO THIS:** [Primary task in one clear sentence]

## Prerequisites
- [List any required tools, permissions, or setup]

## Workflow

### 1. [First Major Step]
```bash
[Commands or code]
```

### 2. [Second Major Step]
[Instructions or tool calls]

### 3. [Verification Step]
```bash
[Commands to verify success]
```

## Parameters
| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| [param1]  | [what it does] | [default] | [example] |

## Example Usage
```
[Show how to invoke this automation with a simple prompt]
```

## Notes
- [Any warnings, limitations, or special considerations]
- [Alternative approaches if main method fails]
</template>

### 4. Optimization Checklist
- [ ] Combine sequential tool calls that can run in parallel
- [ ] Add error handling for common failure points
- [ ] Include verification steps after critical operations
- [ ] Make hardcoded values into parameters
- [ ] Add cross-platform compatibility where needed
- [ ] Document expected outputs and success criteria

### 5. Testing Instructions
1. Save the automation rule to appropriate directory
2. Test with minimal prompt: "[simple trigger phrase]"
3. Verify all steps execute correctly
4. Check that outputs match expectations

## Example Output

When analyzing a conversation about setting up a development environment, you might create:

```markdown
---
description: Automated dev environment setup with dependency installation and verification
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
# Setup Development Environment

**DO THIS:** Install project dependencies, configure tools, and verify setup.

## Workflow

### 1. Check Prerequisites
```bash
node --version || echo "Node.js not installed"
npm --version || echo "npm not installed"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or pnpm install if pnpm is detected
```

### 3. Run Initial Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run test
```

### 4. Verify Setup
```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Example Usage
"Set up my dev environment"
```

## CRITICAL Reminders
🚨 **ALWAYS** include error handling for critical steps
🚨 **NEVER** hardcode paths or user-specific values
🚨 **DOCUMENT** any assumptions about the environment
🚨 **TEST** the automation with minimal prompts
